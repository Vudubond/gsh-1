Well, this is seriously undocumented code.  The short version is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

And then create a file called /etc/ghosts which lists all the machines you
want to contact.  It would look something like this:

	# Macros
	sunprod=solaris^e450
	# Machines
	#
	# Name		Group		Hardware	OS
	bilbo		prod		intel		linux
	baggins		prod		e4500		solaris
	tolkien		devel		e450		solaris
	
Machine groups are run together with "+"s and "^"s as you see fit:

	ghosts intel+e450

	ghosts prod^intel

The "ghosts" command just shows the resulting list.  "gsh" a group to run
a command:

	gsh devel+intel "cat /etc/motd"

You'll need to have ssh set up with trusted RSA keys, though.  I should
cover that in here too, but it's REALLY late tonight, and I just want to
get this posted so my buddy will quite bugging me about downloading the 
"latest" version.  :P

See the TODO file for the huge list of things I need to do.  Mostly
documentation.  :)

Credit where credit is due: this is very very losely based on the "gsh" tool
that came (comes?) with the Perl distribution, and on extra work by 
Mike Murphy.  My version will do things in parallel, and does proper macro
expansions.  It is released under the GNU General Public License.
